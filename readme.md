# Angular 2 Hello World

This is a starter app based on the [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/swirlycheetah/generator-angular2/blob/master/README.md). My mission was to hack this into an easy-to-consume example of an Angular 2 Hello World.

## Set up
This requires [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) :)
1. `npm install`
2. `gulp dev` to watch for build changes
3. `gulp serve` to serve from the build folder

## Dev
Visit the `/src` folder to start hacking!
